Middleware - function that does some preprocessing on the req and res objects

we run the middleware function before running the callback

the middleware fun will always take three args (req, res, next) 

-- But there are flaws with our home built bodyParser middleware which make it not production grade. 
1. It only creates a req.body for POST requests. There are other req methods which body is used

using the body-parser library accounts for corner cases which our homeade fuction does not

it appears that body parser is deprecated. but i don't want to get bogged down with that. so we will move forward for the time being. it's not the focal point of the project
